The King of love my shep -- herd is,  
whose good -- ness fail -- eth nev -- er.  
I no -- thing lack if I am his,  
and he is mine for -- ev -- er. 

Where streams of liv -- ing wat -- er flow,  
my ran -- somed soul he lead -- eth;   
and where the ver -- dant pas -- tures grow,   
with food ce -- les -- tial feed -- eth.  

Per -- verse and fool -- ish, oft I strayed,  
but yet in love he sought me;  
and on his shoul -- der gent -- ly laid,  
and home, re -- joic -- ing, brought me.  

In death's dark vale I fear no ill,  
with thee, dear Lord, be -- side me;  
thy rod and staff my com -- fort still,  
thy cross be -- fore to guide me.  

Thou spreadst a ta -- ble in my sight;  
thy unc -- tion grace be -- stow -- eth;  
and oh, what trans -- port of de -- light  
from thy pure chal -- ice flow -- eth!  

And so through all the length of days,  
thy good -- ness fail -- eth nev -- er;  
Good Shep -- herd, may I sing thy praise  
with -- in thy house for -- ev -- er.
